A React component library built on [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) and CSS Modules. It's beautifully deisgned and accessible.

## Motivation

natmfat is a closed-source design system that provides a uniform surface for all projects associated with my brand.

This is a component library. Unlike "open code" component registries like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), design and implementation are tightly coupled here. To ensure designs are consistent, you should not be modifying components or their implementation regardless. While natmfat does not provide an exhaustive list of components, I provide composable component utilities, tokens, and CSS layers to make building similarly themed components and overriding styles easy.

## Composition

Every component in natmfat shares a composable interface based on Radix Primitives. If a commonly used component does not exist, I'll bring it in and adjust its style to match the rest of the design system. Each component is familiar and easy to learn.

## Beautiful Defaults

natmfat comes with a large collection of components. They are designed to look good on their own and come together naturally as a consistent system. Because CSS tokens are used exclusively as a source of truth, it's easy to create sitewide themes that fit best the nature of the product.
