## Convention

"Dimmest" represents the color with the least contrast against the background; "strongest" represents the color with the most contrast against the background. This naming scheme is compatible with themes, making it easy to maintain components.

## Color Anatomy

The core primary blue family serves as the primary action color across all products and experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.

import { ColorDemo } from "../components/demos/ColorDemo";

<ColorDemo />

## Layering Model

"Surface" colors are layered on top of each other to create depth and spatial associations. The layering model defines the logic of how colors stack on top of each other in a UI when using natmfat. Aspects of the layering model are built directly into the themes, color tokens, and components.

The layering model does not differ between the light and dark themes.

- In the light themes, the second layer is lightest but become one step darker with each added layer. 
- In the dark themes, layers become one step lighter with each added layer.

import { PaddedSurfaceDemo } from "../components/demos/PaddedSurfaceDemo";

<PaddedSurfaceDemo />

Layers and interactive styles are assigned automagically with the [Surface](/docs/components/Surface) component, so it is unlikely you will ever explicitly assign a layer. Dialogs or modals have the highest layer by default.

## Themes

There are two default themes: light, and dark. Themes serve as an organizational framework for color in natmfat, and are enabled using a [Theme Provider](/docs/components/theme-provider).

## Interaction States

There are five other interaction states defined with tokens for each theme. Interaction tokens are assigned automatically through layered surfaces or colorways, and interaction states can be applied with the [Interactive](/docs/components/Interactive) component.   

import { InteractiveDemo } from "../components/demos/InteractiveDemo";
