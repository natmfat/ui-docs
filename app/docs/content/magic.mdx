description: Using pre-built components built with natmfat
---

natmfat provides a set of reusable components for nearly all of your needs. However, some design patterns are still common and frequently shared across apps built with natmfat. This may just be one component, such as the randomized [Logo](/docs/magic/logo) component. Even so, it's annoying to keep re-implementing the same styles and logic. Rather than ship a random collection of components that may or may not be used directly in the natmfat bundle, I created a different addon bundle collectively called "Magic". Magic components are built with natmfat's primitives, styling tokens, and compositional components, so they will fit right in your natmfat apps.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @natmfat/magic
```

## Usage

Include components like you would any other natmfat component. Start with [Logo](/docs/magic/logo)!
