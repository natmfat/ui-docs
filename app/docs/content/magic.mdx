description: Using pre-built components built with natmfat
---

natmfat provides a set of reusable components for nearly all of your needs. However, some design patterns are still common and frequently shared across apps built with natmfat. This may just be one component, such as the randomized [Logo](/docs/magic/logo) component. Even so, it's annoying to keep re-implementing the same styles and logic. Rather than ship a random collection of components that may or may not be used directly in the natmfat bundle, I created a set of copy-pastable code snippets collectively called "Magic". Magic components are built with natmfat's primitives, styling tokens, and compositional components, so they will fit right in your natmfat apps.

## Installation

You can copy and paste Magic components directly from the documentation, or you can use the natmfat CLI tool that ships with the component library. Functionally, there is no difference. Downloading a component using the CLI tool will access the natmfat component registry, which is essentially the REST API form of the documentation.

## Usage

@todo

```bash
natmfat config
```

```bash
natmfat config output "app/components"
```

```bash
natmfat add logo
```
